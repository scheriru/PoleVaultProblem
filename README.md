# PoleVaultProblem

This MATLAB code is supplement to the problem studied in the paper published on ASME Journal of Applied Mechanics - 
"Kinetic to Potential Energy Transformation Using a Spring as an Intermediary: Application to the Pole Vault Problem"

This case is to solve the dynamics of the Point Mass and Elastica System without Applied Torque. Input variables are Initial angle: alpha, Non-dimensional weight: w, and Initial velocity: v


The main file is: Simulation_MassElastica

Notes:
-The coordinate system of the elastica problem is adjusted to represent the problem
-Pre-bending is added to avoid numerical issues.
